For almost five years, photographer and mom Leilani Rogers has been taking stunning images of birth in its many forms -- home births, hospital deliveries, water births, C-sections and more. "Birth is considered by many to be a private matter," Rogers told The Huffington Post. "And yet, it is this amazing thing that we should be teaching our children about and celebrating. So I think people view these photos as equal parts enlightening and fascinating." Recently, Rogers shared a compilation of some of the most powerful birth photos from her archives. While the photos empower the moms they depict and sometimes help heal memories of times when they felt weak or vulnerable, the images also prompt conversation around a somewhat taboo topic. "I sincerely hope that these photos normalize birth -- show that is isn't 'gross,'" the photographer said. "There are people in this world who won't even subject themselves to discussing birth, let alone viewing images of it. But I don't see how anyone can deny that these images portray birth as the miraculous occasion that it can be." "It doesn't matter if you birth at home, in a birth center, in a hospital, vaginally, or by C-section. Birth is birth!" Rogers continued. "We all work hard to bring our babies into this world. And we all love them with every fiber of our being! Most importantly, in the end we all hold the same divine position as 'mother.'" Keep scrolling for a look at Rogers' birth photography.
